# COEX — Current AI Task

## Teams backend and policy deployment verified — 22 October 2026

Owner authorised complete rollout with guided explanations. Application PR #26 merged as `77e84585ce0626aa8f9dbcddf5bb2518ec5bb5ab`; PR CI https://github.com/digisol-ae/COEX/actions/runs/39721227941 and main CI https://github.com/digisol-ae/COEX/actions/runs/39721496951 passed. Local full workspace types/lint, 40 unit files / 249 tests, formatting, Microsoft Teams manifest schema and local/server builds passed; server native Turbopack build generated 67 pages.

Server `/srv/coex/app` clean at application SHA after deploy, four expected PM2 processes online with no duplicates and one additional restart each (cumulative restart count 2). Backup before release: `coex-2026-10-22-0813.archive.gz` (481K), `files-2026-10-22-0813.tar.gz` (14M), under `/srv/coex/shared/backups` (server timestamp). Teams environment configured without exposing credentials; draft secret generated privately, prior environment backed up mode 600. Existing Microsoft sign-in issuer matches directory; active linked-account count 8. Production dependency audit: 0 vulnerabilities; all-dependency report has 8 development findings (2 moderate, 6 high), no forced upgrades.

Live verification: https://coex.digisol.ae/privacy, /terms and /login return 200; operator Digisol LLC-FZ, contact info@digisol.ae and public policy links verified. Teams endpoint returns 401 for well-formed unsigned invoke (configured and refusing unauthenticated access). No real Teams invoke/task creation yet. ZIP `/Users/syedali/Downloads/COEX-Teams-1.0.0.zip` prepared; SHA256 `2b0fe5e748e09a271c6bb5f4d536fd65d52dbcef0b573d7f54fd7e9a150ce72d`. Microsoft schema validation passed, Developer Portal/client installation acceptance remains pending.

Next: user installs ZIP through Teams approved custom-app process, then validate actual message action, linked staff identity, destination/eligible assignee, one saved task/source link and duplicate prevention. Native browser automation unavailable; no visual/Teams end-to-end claim. Public policy deployment completes; **Teams installation and functional pilot remain open**. No separate `projects/` files committed. File-type explanations are in `ai/RELEASE-2026-10-22-TEAMS.md`; implementation/operating guides in `docs/MICROSOFT-TEAMS.md` and `docs/LEGAL-PAGES.md`. Subsequent docs-only pull requires no application rebuild/restart.

## Public Privacy Policy and Terms — 22 October 2026

Owner requested both policies and supplied legal operator **Digisol LLC-FZ**, contact **info@digisol.ae**. Added public `/privacy` and `/terms`, shared responsive policy layout and login/recovery footer links. Copy covers COEX and Teams data/use, actual archive/retention limits, permissions and existing-agreement precedence without invented legal jurisdiction or certification. Teams package defaults to these URLs and uses the legal publisher name. [Edit/rebuild guide](../docs/LEGAL-PAGES.md) records authoritative files and decisions; Microsoft Teams guide records user-reported Azure configuration and public app/directory IDs.

Local web typecheck, focused ESLint, formatting and Webpack production build passed (67 pages). Signed-out HTTP checks passed for both policies and login, including operator/contact/date/navigation. Browser visual QA unavailable. Local Teams ZIP regenerated with real public app ID and production policy URLs, but production URLs are not deployed/verified. No commit/push/deploy, live task or Teams installation. Existing `projects/` remains untouched.

## Microsoft Teams task integration — 22 October 2026

User approved starting Teams message → COEX task integration. Local branch `codex/teams-create-task` adds a verified invoke endpoint, destination-first Adaptive Card form, eligible assignees, title/description/priority/due date, original message link and Open in COEX confirmation. Uses existing linked Entra staff identity, pinned Microsoft/COEX tenant, active account/task permission checks, private Space/Folder visibility and assignment rules. Signed 15-minute drafts and unique submission receipts prevent duplicate creation from retries; uncertain outcomes require checking task list before a new form.

Validation: existing unit suite plus Teams protocol/service tests **39 files / 244 tests passed**; additional Teams HTTP boundary tests **5/5 passed**. Web TypeScript, focused ESLint, Prettier and production Webpack build passed (**65 pages**, new Teams route included). Test package generated with synthetic public IDs/URLs; colour/outline icons verified 192×192 and 32×32 with alpha. No live MongoDB/Teams end-to-end acceptance or Developer Portal validation yet.

Setup and limits: [Microsoft Teams guide](../docs/MICROSOFT-TEAMS.md). Needs Microsoft single-tenant bot registration/channel, actual public privacy/terms pages, server environment configuration and pilot app installation. Missing config disables endpoint. No Graph/chat-history access, attachment copying or automatic chat posting. No secret changed, real task created, commit/push/deployment or Microsoft resource created. Existing untracked `projects/` preserved. What's new entry deferred until activation because this integration is not yet available to users.

## Release complete — 21 October 2026

John authorized the full reviewed COEX bundle, GitHub upload and app-server release. PR #24 merged as `ad6b8a6c5bd70df876e90709e2f33d96036ca851`; CI green, backup completed, server pull/install/native build/restarts successful. Four expected PM2 processes online with no duplicates; clean checkout and HTTPS/new public assets verified. Documentation follow-up records this outcome.

Validation: full workspace types/lint, formatting, 227 unit tests and local/server production builds passed; focused database and image browser evidence in the release/QA notes. No new full DB-suite all-clear.

Remaining: earlier QA findings in compact context, tiny-image 0 KB display; full database regression if needed for follow-up changes. Separate dOne project files remain untracked and excluded.

Read [release evidence](RELEASE-2026-10-21.md), [deployment status](../deploy/DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md), and [compact context](CONTEXT-2026-10-21.md). Await next user task; do not infer new release authority from this completed run.
